📈 Price Optimization & Revenue Impact Analysis
🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of pricing decisions on revenue using real-world retail transaction data.
The goal is to simulate different pricing scenarios, understand how price changes influence demand, and identify an optimal price range that maximizes revenue.

The analysis is designed from a business analytics perspective, emphasizing clarity, assumptions, and actionable insights rather than complex economic theory.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical retail sales data to understand pricing patterns

Simulate price changes and evaluate their impact on total revenue

Identify an optimal price point for revenue maximization

Communicate insights clearly using visualizations

🗂️ Dataset

Source: Online Retail Transaction Dataset (Kaggle / UCI)

Type: Real-world e-commerce transaction data

Key Columns Used

InvoiceNo – Transaction identifier

InvoiceDate – Transaction date

StockCode – Product identifier

Quantity – Units sold

UnitPrice – Price per unit

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data cleaning and transformation

🔬 Methodology

Data Cleaning

Removed cancelled transactions and invalid pricing records

Converted dates and created revenue metrics

Data Aggregation

Aggregated data at the product level

Filtered low-volume products to reduce noise

Price Simulation

Simulated multiple price change scenarios

Estimated corresponding changes in revenue

Optimization

Identified the price change that maximizes overall revenue

Compared baseline vs optimized revenue

Visualization

Plotted price vs demand patterns

Visualized revenue trends across pricing scenarios

📊 Key Insights

Revenue does not increase linearly with price changes

There exists an optimal pricing range where revenue is maximized

Small, data-driven pricing adjustments can lead to meaningful revenue improvements

Visual analysis plays a critical role in communicating pricing insights
